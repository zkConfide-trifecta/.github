# 🧠 zkConfide: Private, Personalized Betting Protocol

**zkConfide** is a next-gen prediction market protocol designed for privacy-preserving, personalized, and MEV-resistant betting experiences. It enables users to place on-chain bets on real-world events using USDC, with outcomes resolved via **zkProofs** and market dynamics powered by **Uniswap v4 Hooks**. Each user receives tailored betting suggestions based on risk appetite, powered by AI.

Built to defend against frontrunning and execution manipulation, zkConfide ensures all bets are executed transparently on-chain, while intent, user strategy, and outcome resolution remain private and policy-bound — safeguarding against MEV attacks, slippage abuse, and data leakage.

## 🧩 Uniswap V4 Hook Advance AMM – Base Sepolia

We successfully deployed the **PredictionMarketHook** contract on **Base Sepolia** using a CREATE2 deployer, enabling deterministic and permissionless hook address generation.

## 🚀 Marlin Integration – TEE-Backed Relays for Privy + NilQL Wallets

We use **Marlin** to relay signed transactions from zkConfide’s **ephemeral server wallets**, which are built on **Privy** and **NilQL**.

Marlin provides **infrastructure inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, allowing us to:

- Execute **wallet signing, encryption, and relaying** in a secure enclave.
- Keep betting logic, user keys, and transaction sequencing **private and tamper-proof**.
- Prevent censorship and reduce latency in prediction market transactions.

### 🧾 Example Relayed Transaction:

## 🌟 Key Features/User Flow

### ✅ Social Login with Privy & nilQL
- Seamless onboarding using social login.
- A **server wallet** is instantiated via Privy for each user, allowing secure interaction with smart contracts using custom policies while abstracting private key management.

### 🎯 AI-Powered Risk Personalization with Nillion TEE (Secret LLM)
- Users select events and receive personalized odds and betting suggestions.
- AI models analyze user risk profiles and event data to recommend optimal YES/NO outcomes.

### 🧩 On-Chain Bets via Uniswap v4 Hooks
- Bets are placed on-chain using **USDC**, swapped into YES/NO outcome tokens via a **custom Uniswap v4 Hook** (`PredictionMarketHook`).
- Swaps are MEV-resistant and governed by internal hook logic to prevent front-running or manipulation.

### 💧 Liquidity Participation
- Users can add/remove liquidity in the YES/USDC and NO/USDC pools.
- LPs earn fees and indirectly help shape odds based on market depth.

### 🔐 Event Resolution via zkProofs
- Market outcomes are verified using **zkProofs** via `IProver`-based resolvers.
- zkOracles fetch results from off-chain trusted data sources and submit proofs on-chain.
- No single party can manipulate or delay market resolution.

### 💰 Trustless Winnings Settlement
- Token holders of the winning outcome redeem their tokens for USDC.
- zkProofs ensure that only valid claims can be executed on-chain.

### 🔄 Smart Fund Management
- After settlement, users can:
  - Reuse funds for new bets.
  - Withdraw privately from the server wallet to an external wallet.
  - Stay anonymous throughout via batched, private withdrawals.
